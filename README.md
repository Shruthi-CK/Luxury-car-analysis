# Luxury-car-analysis
This project analyzes 10k car posts from Edmunds forum to find the most "aspirational" brand. It uses a scraper to gather posts, then measures how often brands are discussed together (lift) to create a "map" of competitors (MDS). The findings show Audi is most associated with aspirational language.
